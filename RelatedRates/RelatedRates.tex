\emph{Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Start by defining all variables, each in a complete sentence with units. Be sure to precisely define the variable for time as well.

\item Answer each problem with a concluding sentence.
\end{itemize}


\section{Kite Flying}
\begin{question} \label{Q9oigohonn}
A kite drifts due east as it maintains a constant altitude. Play the slider $u$ in Line 1 of the worksheet below to watch the motion.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which do you think is greater, the rate at which the string is being let out or the speed of the kite? No computations, just go with your intuition.

\item Express the speed of the kite (not assumed constant) in terms of the rate at which the string is being let out (\emph{not} assumed constant) and the angle $\theta$ the string makes with the horizontal.

\item What can you say if $\theta =  \pi/3$?

\item Was your intuition correct?
\end{enumerate}

\section{A Crawling Beetle}
\begin{question}  \label{Qbnmkgytyuu}
As a beetle crawling in the $xy$-plane passes the point $(-4,-3)$ (coordinates in centimeters) its distance from the $x$-axis is increasing at the rate of $2$ cm/sec and its distance from the origin is increasing at the rate of $3$ cm/sec.

Is the beetle rotating clockwise or counterclockwise at this instant? At what rate?

\end{question}

\section{A Mechanical Motion}
\begin{question}  \label{Q34fdffffhggg}
As a rod $OP$ of length $R$ meters rotates about its endpoint $O$, the other endpoint $P$ drags along a second rod $PA$ of length $L$ meters as illustrated below.

\href{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/l03dlyifb0}{151: Engine}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Express the speed of $A$ in terms of $R$, $L$, the angle $\theta$ shown above, and the rotation rate $\omega$ (measured in radians/sec) of rod $OP$. Do \emph{not} assume $\omega$ is constant. Woirk in general, not with the specific values of $L$ and $R$ in the worksheet.

\item Check that your expression in  part (a) has the correct units.

\item Express the signed rotation rate of $PA$ in terms of the same parameters. Measure the rate to be postive when $PA$ rotates counterclockwise. Do not assume $\omega$ is constant.

\item Check that your expression in  part (c) has the correct units.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Jar Lid and Rubber Band}
\begin{question}  \label{Qbnmdfgh}
You wrap a rubber band around a circluar jar lid and pull the band tight as illustrated below.

\href{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vnu7ig4ntg}{151: String and Jar Lid}

Suppose at some instant you are pulling the point $P$ of the rubber band directly away from the center of the lid at a speed of $v$ inches/sec. Express the rate (in inches/sec) at which the length of the rubber band is changing at this instant in terms of $v$ and the marked angle $\theta$ between the straight segments of the band at $P$.
\end{question}

\section{Disco Dancing}
\begin{question}
A spotlight in a circular dance hall of radius $r$ meters is located $b$ meters from the center of the hall. 

At some instant the light is rotating at the rate of $\omega$ rad/sec.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression for the speed of the light beam as it moves along the wall at this instant. Your expression should be in terms of $\omega$, $r$, $b$, and the angle $\theta$ marked below.

\item Check that your expression in  part (a) has the correct units.
