\begin{question}  \label{Q34fdffffhggg}
A tree leans precariously with its trunk making an angle of $\phi = \pi/3$ radians with the ground. One end of a ladder leans against the trunk, the other rests on the horizontal ground.

At the moment the bottom end of the ladder is $8$ feet from the tree's base (in the position shown below), its bottom end is moving toward the tree's base at a speed of $5$ ft/sec. At this same moment the top end of the ladder is $3$ feet from the tree's base.
