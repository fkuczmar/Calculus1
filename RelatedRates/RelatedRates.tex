\emph{Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Start by defining all variables, each in a complete sentence with units. Be sure to precisely define the variable for time as well.

\item Answer each problem with a concluding sentence.
\end{itemize}

\begin{question} \label{Q9oigohonn}
A kite drifts due east as it maintains a constant altitude. Play the slider $u$ in Line 1 of the worksheet below to watch the motion.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which do you think is greater, the rate at which the string is being let out or the speed of the kite? No computations, just go with your intuition.

\item Express the speed of the kite (not assumed constant) in terms of the rate at which the string is being let out (\emph{not} assumed constant) and the angle $\theta$ the string makes with the horizontal.

\item What can you say if $\theta =  \pi/3$?

\item Was your intuition correct?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{question}  \label{Q34fdffffhggg}
As a rod $OP$ of length $R$ meters rotates about its endpoint $O$, the other endpoint $P$ drags along a second rod $PA$ of length $L$ meters as illustrated below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Express the speed of $A$ in terms of $R$, $L$, the angle $\theta$ shown above, and the rotation rate $\omega$ (measured in radians/sec) of rod $OP$. Do \emph{not} assume $\omega$ is constant. Woirk in general, not with the specific values of $L$ and $R$ in the worksheet.

\item Express the signed rotation rate of $PA$ in terms of the same parameters. Measure the rate to be postive when $PA$ rotates counterclockwise. Do not assume $\omega$ is constant.
\end{enumerate}
