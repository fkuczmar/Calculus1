\section{Visualizing Derivatives}
\begin{question}  \label{Qdfgtt5ttt55}

You ride a ferris wheel for one revolution and get off. Let 
\[
    h = f(s) \, , 0\leq s \leq ??,
\]
be the function that expresses your height above the ground (measured in feet) in terms of your distance traveled, measured (in feet) along your path from your starting point.

(a) Choose a radius for the ferris wheel that you think is reasonable and fill in the missing upper bound for the domain of $f$ above.

(b) Use the demonstration below to sketch by hand a graph of the function 
\[
     r = \frac{dh}{ds} = f^\prime(s) .
\] 
Do \emph{not} make any computations. Just use the demonstration below. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Approximate the derivative $dh/ds$ by the ratio $\Delta h / \Delta s$}.

\item{The length of the red arclength (when the ferris wheel is on the way up) is the input $s$. }

\item{The length of the purple segment is the output $h$.}

\item{The lengths of the orange arc and orange segments are $\Delta s$.}

\item{The (signed) length of the green segment is  $\Delta h$.}

\end{itemize}




Explain your reasoning thoroughly. Be sure to include at least the following points:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The units of the input and output to the derivative}

\item{Scales on the vertical and horizontal axes}

\item{A discussion of how a small change in the input to the function $f$ changes the output at various positions along your ride. }

\item{A discussion of where a small change in the input to $f$ gives the greatest positive change in the output and a consideration of the ratios of these changes }

\item{A discussion of where a small change in the input to $f$ gives the negative change in the output with the greatest magnitude and a consideration of the ratios of these changes }

\item{A discussion of where a small change in the input to $f$ barely changes the output and a consideration of the ratios of these changes }

\end{itemize}

(c) How would your graph of the derivative $dh/ds$ change if you doubled the radius of the ferris wheel? Sketch the new graph.
