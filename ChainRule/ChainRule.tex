The chain rule tells us how to differentiate the composition of two functions. It say that the derivative of the composition is the product of the derivatives of the two functions.

Here is a more formal statement.

\begin{theorem}
(The Chain Rule) If $y=f(u)$ is a differentiable function of $u$ and $u=g(t)$ is a differentiable function of $t$, then the composition
\[
      y = f(g(t))
\]
is a differentiable function of $t$ and
\[
   \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dt} .
\]
Or paying closer attention to the inputs,
\[
      \frac{dy}{dt}\Big|_{t=t_0} = \frac{dy}{du}\Big|_{u=g(t_0)} \cdot \frac{du}{dt}\Big|_{t=t_0} . 
\]

\end{theorem}


We'll go through some examples to get an understanding of how to use the chain rule and also why it works.


\begin{example}  \label{Ex:GDFGDFGff}
Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve
\[
  y = f(x) = \left( 2x^3 +1  \right)^2
\]
at the point $(1,9)$.

\begin{explanation}
Let 
\[
       y = \left( 2x^3 +1  \right)^2
\]
and 
\[
      u = 2x^3 + 1 .
\]
Then
\[
     y = u^2
\]
and
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}  \\
                     &= \frac{d}{du} \left( u^2 \right)  \cdot \frac{d}{dx}\left(  2x^3 + 1 \right)  \\
                     &= 2u (6x^2)  \\
                     &= 2(2x^3+1)(6x^2) .
\end{align*}

Then the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y=(2x^3+1)^2$ at the point $(1,9)$ is 
\[
              \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=1} = 2(3)(6) = 36 ,
\]
and an equation of the tangent line is
\[
   y - 9 = 36(x-1) .
\]

\pskip 

We can get the same result without the chain rule, by rewriting the original function as
\[
     y = f(x) = (2x^3+1)^2 = 4x^6 + 4x^3 + 1.
\] 
Then
\begin{align*}
      \frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{d}{dx} \left(  4x^6 + 4x^3 + 1  \right) \\
                         &= 4\frac{d}{dx}\left( x^6 \right) + 4 \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^3 \right) + \frac{d}{dx}\left(1 \right) \\
                        &=   24x^5 + 12x^2 .
\end{align*}

Then the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y=(2x^3+1)^2$ at the point $(1,9)$ is 
\[
              \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=1} =14 + 12 = 36 ,
\]
as before.

\end{explanation}
\end{example}


\begin{example}  \label{Ex:DFdg4ergg}
Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve
\[
     x^2 + y^2 = 25
\]
at the point $P(4,-3)$.

\begin{explanation}
Solve the above equation for $y$ in terms of $x$ to get
\[
      y = \pm \sqrt{25-x^2} .
\] 
While this equation does not define $y$ as a function of $x$, near the point $(4,-3)$, the equation
\[
         y = - \sqrt{25-x^2} 
\]
does define $y$ as a function of $x$.

Now to find the derivative of the function
\[
          y = - \sqrt{25-x^2} ,
\]
let 
\[
       u = 25 - x^2 .
\]
Then
\[
    y = \sqrt{u} = - u^{1/2}
\]
and 
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}  \\
                     &= \frac{d}{du} \left(- u^{1/2} \right)  \cdot \frac{d}{dx}\left(  25-x^2 \right)  \\
                     &= -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}} (-2x)  \\
                     &= \frac{x}{\sqrt{25-x^2}}.
\end{align*}

So the slope of the tangent line to the curve
\[
       x^2 + y^2 =25
\]
at the point $(P(4,-3)$ is
\[
             \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=4} = \left(  \frac{x}{\sqrt{25-x^2}} \right) \Big|_{x=4} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
and an equation of the tangent line is
\[
     y +3 = \frac{4}{3} (x-4).
\]

To find the slope of the tangent line without appealing to the chain rule, note that the curve
\[
              x^2 + y^2  = 25
\]
is a circle centered at the origin. So the tangent line at $P(4,-3)$ is perpendicular to the radius $\overline{OP}$ from the origin to $P$. Since $\overline{OP}$ has slope $m_1 = -3/4$, the tangent line at $P(4,-3)$ has slope
\[
     m_2 = - 1 / m_1  = 4/3 .
\]
\end{explanation}

\begin{example}  \label{Ex:pdfsd0tr}
The function 
\[
       P  = f(t) = 22 + \frac{t}{2} - \frac{3t^2}{4} , 0\leq t \leq 3 , 
\]
expresses the price of a stock (in dollars/share) in terms of the number of hours past 9am.

(a) Is the price of the stock increasing or decreasing at 11am? At what rate? At what relative rate?

(b) Is the number of shares you can buy with $\$1000$ increasing or decreasing at 11am? At what rate? At what relative rate?
\end{example}



\begin{example} \label{Ex:sd0fset}
At 10am the price of a stock is increasing at the relative rate of $p\%$/hr. Is the number of shares you can buy with $\$1000$ increasing or decreasing at 10am? At what relative rate?


\end{example}


\begin{example}  \label{Ex:CHr34rrer}
(a) Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve
\[
   y = f(\theta) = 6 \sin \theta
\]
at the point with coordinates $P(2\pi/3, 3\sqrt{3})$. We do not need the chain rule for this.

(b) Describe a transformation that takes the graph of $y=f(\theta)$ to the graph of the function
\[
        y = g(\theta) = 6\sin (\theta/2) .
\]

(c) Find the image of the point $P(2\pi/3,3\sqrt{3})$ under the above transformation.

(d) Use the results of parts (a) - (c) and the demonstration below to guess the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y=g(\theta)$ at the point $Q(4\pi,3\sqrt{3})$.

\end{example}


\begin{example}  \label{Ex:Chdfr5llk}
The function 
\[
       P = f(t) = 10 e^{\frac{1}{4}t} \, , \, -4\leq t \leq 12 ,
\] 
expresses the population (in millions) of a colony of bacteria in terms of the number of hours past noon.

(a) What are the units of $1/4$ in the function above? How do you know?

(b)  Use the chain rule to find an expression for the growth rate of the population at time $t$ hours past noon. What are the units of the growth rate?

(c) Express the growth rate from part (b) in terms of the population $P=f(t)$ at time $t$ hours past noon.

(d) What is the relative instantaneous growth rate of the population? Include units.

(e) Find the relative average growth rate of the population over a one-hour period. 

(f) Describe what happens to the population every hour.

\end{example}

\begin{example}  \label{Ex:CHHODDrer}
 (a) Use the chain rule to find the relative instantaneous growth rate of the population function
\[
      P = 10 (2^t)  \, , \, -2\leq t \leq 5 ,
\]
where $P$ is measured in millions of bacteria and $t$ is the number of hours past noon.

(b) Describe what happens to the population every hour.

(c) Estimate the population 2 minutes after there are 30 million bacteria.

\begin{example}  \label{Ex:CHdfthghhyhpp}

You ride a ferris wheel for one revolution and get off. The function 
\[
    h = f(\theta) = \, , \, 0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi    %40 - 30\cos \theta \, , \, 0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi ,
\]
expresses your height (in feet) in terms of the wheel's angle of rotation (measured in radians from the moment you boarded).

The function 
\[
    \theta = g(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 44, 
\]
expresses the rotation angle of the wheel in terms of the number of seconds since  you boarded.

Use the graphs of the function $f$ and $g$ below (take the times $t$ to be postive, not negative as shown) to approximate each of the following:

(a) The value of the derivative 
\[
   \frac{dh}{d\theta}\Big|_{t = 16} .
\]

(b) The rotation rate of the wheel 16 seconds after you boarded.

(c) The value of the derivative 
\[
    \frac{d\theta}{dt}\Big|_{t=16} .
\]

(d) The rate at which you are ascending at time $t=16$ seconds after you boarded.

(e) The value of the derivative
\[
   \frac{dh}{dt}\Big|_{t=16}  =  h^\prime(16),
\]
where $h(t) = f(g(t))$.
