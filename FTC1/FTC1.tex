\begin{question} \label{QPfeEFVVD}

The function 
\[
 v=f(t) \, , \, , 0 \leq t \leq 8, 
\]
expresses the speed (in feet/min) of a beetle in terms of the number of minutes past noon.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write an expression for the distance the beetle crawls from 12:03pm to 12:07pm. Use the graph of the function $v=f(t)$ below to approximate this distance.

\item Write an equation you would solve to determine when the beetle is halfway to its destination. Start by defining an unknown (in a complete sentence, with units). Do not use $t$, it is already taken.

\item Use the graph of the function $v=f(t)$ below to approximate the time in part (b). But first determine whether this time is before or after 12:04pm.

\item Suppose 
\[
      v(t) = \frac{20}{(t+2)^2}. 
\] 
and determine the exact time when the beetle is halfway to its destination.

\begin{question} \label{Q3edFGee}

The function
\[
 r =f(t) \, , \,  2 \leq t  \leq 36,
\]
 gives the net rate (in gal/min) at which water flows into a tank at time $t$ minutes past noon.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write an expression that gives the change in volume from 12:15pm to 12:32pm.

\item Write an equation you would solve to find when the tank holds $22$ fewer gallons than it does at 12:09pm. Start by defining an unknown (in a complete sentence, with units). Do not use $t$, it is already taken.

\item Use the graph of the function
 \[
 r =f(t) \, , \,  2 \leq t  \leq 36,
\]
 shown below to approximate the time(s) when the tank holds 22 fewer gallons than it does at 12:09. Then use algebra to find the exact times. But first label the axes below with the appropriate variable names and units.

\begin{question} \label{QKDfer3fr}

%Explain your understanding of what our OER text calls Part II of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (page 396) and
% how it relates to the Net Change Theorem. State the theorem, explain what
 %it says, and give some computational examples.
 %Then explain why the theorem is true, giving intuitive examples illustrat
%ing a variety (at least 3) applications. In the course of your explanation,
% address and answer the following question.
 
The function
\[
 m=f(s) \, , \, 30\leq s \leq 300
\]
expresses your gas mileage (in miles/gallon) in terms of your distance from home. The distance is measured along your route in miles. 

Your tank has $12$ gallons of gas when you are $50$ miles from home.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose you are driving away from home. Find a function $G_1 = g_1(s)$ that expresses the number of gallons in your tank
in terms of your distance (measured along your route in miles) from home.

\item Suppose you are driving toward home. Find a function $G_2 = g_2(s)$ that expresses the number of gallons in your tank
in terms of your distance (measured along your route in miles) from home.

\end{enumerate}

% Finally, point out any aspects of the theorem that you do not fully under
stand or ask about something you would like to know more about.
