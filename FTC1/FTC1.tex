\begin{question} \label{Q3edFGee}

The function
\[
 r =f(t) \, , \,  2 \leq t  \leq 36,
\]
 gives the net rate (in gal/min) at which water flows into a tank at time $t$ minutes past noon.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write an expression that gives the change in volume from 12:15pm to 12:32pm.

\item Write an equation you would solve to find when the tank holds $22$ fewer gallons than it does at 12:09pm. Start by defining your unknown (in a complete sentence, with units). Do not use $t$, it is already taken.

\item Use the graph of the function
 \[
 r =f(t) \, , \,  2 \leq t  \leq 36,
\]
 shown below to approximate the time(s) when the tank holds 22 fewer gallons than it does at 12:09. Then use algebra to find the exact times. But first label the axes below with the appropriate variable names and units.

\end{enumerate}
