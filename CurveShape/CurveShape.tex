\begin{question}  \label{Q56hnnhfgh}
The function
\[
      C = f(t) = A e^{-kt} \, , \, t\geq 0 ,
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the units of $A$? Of $k$? Explain how you know.



\item Find an expression for the time when the concentration is a maximum.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Justify your assertion without relying on a graph.

\item Check that your expression has the correct units.
\end{enumerate}

\item Find an expression for the times when
