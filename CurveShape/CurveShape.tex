\begin{question}  \label{Q56hnnhfgh}
The function
\[
      C = f(t) = A e^{-kt} \, , \, t\geq 0 ,
\]
expresses the concentration of a drug (in mg/L) in terms of the number of hours since the drug was injected. Here $A$ and $k$ are postive constants.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the units of $A$? Of $k$? Explain how you know.



\item Find an expression for the time when the concentration is a maximum.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Justify your assertion without relying on a graph.

\item Check that your expression has the correct units.
\end{enumerate}

\item Find an expression for the times when
\begin{enumerate}
\item the concentration is increasing at its maximum rate.

\item the concentration is decreasing at its maximum rate.

\end{enumerate}
Justify your assertion without relying on a graph.


\item Determine all time intervals during which 

\begin{enumerate}
\item the concentration is increasing at an increasing rate.

\item the concentration is increasing at an increasing rate.

\item the concentration is decreasing at an increasing rate.

\item the concentration is decreasing at an decreasing rate.

\end{enumerate}
Justify your assertion without relying on a graph.
