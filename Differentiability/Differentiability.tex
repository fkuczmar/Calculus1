An introduction to what it means for a function to be differentiable.

\maketitle

Zoom in closer and closer near a point $(a,f(a))$ on the graph of a common function $f$ and you'll most likely notice that the graph looks more and more like the graph of a linear function. If so, we say the function $y=f(x)$ is \emph{differentiable} at $x=a$. And the \emph{derivative} of the function, evaluated at $x=a$, written as
\[
     \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=a},
\]
is the slope of that linear function.

\begin{exploration}  \label{Exp:34gt4trt}
Use the graph of the function $y=f(x)$ below to answer the following questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Is the function $y=f(x)$ differentiable at $x=1$? If so, approximate the derivative
\[
      \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=1}.
\]
Explain your reasoning.

\item Is the function $y=f(x)$ differentiable at $x=0$? If so, approximate the derivative
\[
      \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=0}.
\]
Explain your reasoning.
\end{itemize}
