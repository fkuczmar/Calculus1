An introduction to what it means for a function to be differentiable.

\maketitle

Zoom in closer and closer near a point on a graph of a common function and you'll most likely notice that the graph looks more and more like the graph of a linear function. If so, we say the function is \emph{differentiable} at that particular input. And the \emph{derivative} of the function, evaluated at that input, is just the slope of that linear function.
