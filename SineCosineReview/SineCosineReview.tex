\section{Transformations}

\begin{question}  \label{QPODFerRE}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The point with coordinates $(a,b)$ lies on the graph of the function $y=f(x)$. What are the coordinates of the corresponding point on the graph of the function 
\[
  y = g(x) = f(x/2)?
\]

\item Express the derivative
\[
    \frac{d}{dx}\left( g(x) \right)\Big|_{x=2a} =  \frac{d}{dx}\left( f(x/2) \right)\Big|_{x=2a}
\]
in terms of the derivative
\[
       \frac{d}{dx}\left(  f(x) \right)\Big|_{x=a} .
\]

\item Compute the slopes of the tangent lines to the curves $y=\sin\theta$ and $y=\sin(\theta/2)$ at the origin. Drag the slider $k$ in the worksheet below to visualize the transformation.

\item Which of the following curves share the same tangent line at the origin with the curve $y=\sin\theta$?

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$y=2\sin\theta$}
\choice{$y=2\sin (2\theta)$}
\choice[correct]{$y=2\sin(\theta/2)$}
\choice[correct]{$y=\frac{1}{3}\sin(3\theta)$}
\choice{$y=\frac{1}{3}\sin(\theta/3)$}
\end{selectAll}

\section{Simple Harmonic Motion}

\begin{question} \label{QODFIER33r3r}
A mass at the end of a spring oscillates in simple harmonic motion on a horizontal surface as shown below. The mass is released from rest $2$ meters from its equilibrium position and it completes one oscillation every $5$ seconds.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Where is the mass when it is moving at $2/3$ of its maximum speed? 

\item At what fraction of its maximum speed is the mass traveling when it is $3/4$ of the way from its equilibrium position to one if its extreme positions?
\end{enumerate}

\end{question}

\section{Ferris Wheel}
\begin{question}  \label{QOERERERERQ}
A ferris wheel rotates at a constant rate, making one revolution every $90$ seconds. The wheel has a radius of $50$ feet and its center is $60$ feet above the ground.

You ride the wheel for one revolution and jump off.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is your speed as you ride the wheel?

\item At what rate are you ascending when you are $20$ feet above the ground for the second time?
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\section{Flagpole and Track}


\begin{question} \label{QPEErmE}

You run around a circular track of radius $50$ feet at a constant speed of $v$ ft/sec, passing point $A$ at time $t=0$ seconds psat noon (see the animation below). A flagpole is located at point $F$, $80$ feet from the track's center and $30$ feet from $A$ as shown.

\end{onlineOnly}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a function
\[
  s =g(t) \, , \, t\geq 0 ,
\]
that expresses your distance to the flagpole (in feet) in terms of the number of seconds past noon.

\item Find an expression for the rate of change (with respect to time) in your distance to the flagpole at time $t$ seconds past noon.

\item Express this rate of change in terms of your speed $v$ and the angle $\phi = \angle OPF$ above as you run around the ``top'' half of the track.


\end{enumerate}
