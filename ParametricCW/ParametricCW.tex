\section{The Basics}

In a sense there is nothing new here. Making a $u$-substitution is equivalent to reparameterizing the graph of a function. 

To see why and to understand what $u$-substitution does geometrically, it helps to think about making a \emph{reverse} $u$-substitution. This means starting with a simple integral and making it more complicated with a substitution. Here's an example.

\begin{example} \label{EKEMrerMMEF34}
We'll start with the integral
\[
      I = \int_0^\pi \sin u \, du
\]
and make the substitution 
\[
     u = t^2 .
\]
This substitution really reparameterizes the curve
\[
   y = f(u) = \sin u \, , \, 0\leq u \leq \pi
\] 
from the standard parameterization
\[
   (x,y) = (u,\cos u) \, , \, 0\leq u \leq \pi
\]
to the new parameterization
\[
   (x,y) = (t^2,\cos (t^2) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq \sqrt{\pi}.
\]

The substitution maps the rectangle with height $y=\sin u$ and width $du$ to the rectangle with the same height $y=\sin(t^2)$ and width
\[
   du = 2t \,dt .
\]
The effect is to transform a partition of the interval of integration, originally $u\in [0,\pi]$ with equal subintervals into a partition of the new interval of integration $t\in [0,\sqrt{2\pi}]$ with \emph{unequal} subintervals $du=2t\, dt$. You can see this transformation by dragging the slider $w$ in Line 2 of the worksheeet below from $w=0$ to $w=1$.
