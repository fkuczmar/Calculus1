\section{The Basics}

Not all curves are the graphs of functions.

The green curve below in the first quadrant, for example, is neither the graph of $y$ as a function of $x$ (ie. $y=f(x)$) nor of $x$ as a function of $y$ (ie. $x=f(y)$).

Why not?

But we can describe the curve \emph{parametrically}. This means to give functions
\[
      x = f(t) \text{ and } y=g(t)
\]
that express the coordinates $(x,y)$ of a point on the curve in terms of some parameter ($t$ here) which is often helpful to think of as being time. We can then think dynamically of the \emph{motion} of a point along its path instead of just a static path.

These coordinate functions for the green curve above are graphed in the fourth ($x=f(t)$) and second ($y=g(t)$) quadrants and share the domain $0\leq t\leq 4$ (you should ignore the negative signs on the vertical and horizontal axes). To see the motion of the point along its path, play the slider $u=t$ in Line 2. 

The question we would like to address here is to compute the unsigned (ie. positive) area of the region bounded by the curve 
\[
  (x,y) = (f(t), g(t)) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 4 .
\]

As usual, our first choice is to decide which way to slice the region and we'll start by slicing perpendicular to the $x$-axis. But this is not really an accurate description because the differential slices run from the $x$-axis to the curve and do not always lie within the region. 

To see this, move the slider the slider $u$ in Line 2 to $u=0.50$ and the slider $v = \Delta t$ in Line 4 to $v=0.3$. You'll see a shaded rectangle that does not lie within the region. Nevertheless, we can use these differential rectangles to compute the area of the region.

The key idea is to work with their \emph{signed} areas. Cutting perpendicular to the $x$-axis, the differential rectangles have signed area
\begin{align*}
 dA & = y \, dx \\
      & = g(t) d(f(t)) \\
      & = g(t) (f^\prime(t) \, dt) \\
      & = g(t) f^\prime (t) dt .
\end{align*}

And so the region bounded by the green curve and the $x$-axis has signed area
\[
   A = \int_0^4 g(t) f^\prime(t) \, dt.
\]

Let's stop and think a minute about what we mean by signed area. The sign of the differential area $dA$ depends upon \emph{both} the signs of $y=g(t)$ and $dx = f^\prime (t) dt$. For our example $y = g(t) \geq 0$, and $dA$ has the same sign as $dx$. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Drag the slider $u$ in Line 2 from $u=0$ to $u=b=4$. For what values of $u$ is $dA$ positive? Negative?

\item Sketch by hand a rough graph of the cumulative signed area function
\[
      A_1(t) = \int_0^t g(u) f^\prime(u) \, du.
\] 

\item How is the integral 
\[
  A_1(4) = \int_0^4 g(t) f^\prime(t) \, dt
\]
related to the area of the region bounded by the $x$A-axisa and the curve $(x,y) = (f(t), g(t))$? Explain your reasoning.
