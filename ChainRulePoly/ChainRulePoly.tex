\begin{question} \label{Q8dfDfrfrf}
The function
\[
      h = f(s) \, , \, 0\leq s \leq 3 ,
\]
expresses the altitude (in thousands of feet) of a trail in terms of the distance (in miles) from the trailhead.

The function
\[
    s = g(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 4,
\]
expresses your distance from the trailhead (in miles) as you hike along the trail in terms of the number of hours past noon.

The functions $f$ and $g$ are graphed below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use the graphs above to estimate the following. Include units and write each as a derivative using the Leibniz notation.

\begin{enumerate}

\item your elevation at 2:30pm.

\item your hiking speed at 2:30pm.

\item the steepness of your part of the trail at 2:30pm. Interpret the meaning of this in terms of small changes.

\item the rate (in feet/hour) at which you are gaining or losing altitude at 2:30pm. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Now suppose that
\[
    h = f(s) = -\frac{s^3}{3} + s^2 + s + 2 \, , \, 0\leq s\leq 3
\]
and
\[
    s = g(t) = 0.1 t^2 + 0.35t \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 4.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the exact values of each of the derivatives in part (a).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{question} \label{QLkmdfdsrr}
Due to a late-season frost in eastern Washington, the price of Cosmic Crisp apples is rising precipitously. The function 
\[
          P = f(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 8 ,
\]
expresses the pirce (in dollars/pound) in terms of the number of hours past 9am on April 25, 2025.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression for the function
\[
       N = g(P)
\]
for the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$ in terms of the price (in dollars/pound).

\item Evaluate the derivative
\[
 \frac{dN}{dP}\Big|_{P=4} .
\]
Include units.

\item Interpret the meaning of the above derivative in terms of small changes.

\item Find an expression for the derivative $dN/dt$ in terms of $P$ and the derivative $dP/dt$.

\item Suppose 
\[
     P = f(t) = 2 + \frac{2}{5}t \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 8 ,
\]
and determine the rate of change (with respect to time) at 2pm in then number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$.

\item Suppose (for an arbitrary differentiable price function) that at some instant the price is decreasing at the relative rate of $10\%$/hour. Is the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$ increasing or decreasing at this instant? At what relative rate?

\end{enumerate}
