\begin{question} \label{QPkdf9fM}
The base of a solid is a disk of radius $a$ meters. Parallel cross-sections perpendicular to the base are squares. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the area of the solid.
\item Compare the solid's volume with the volume of the surrounding cylinder.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{explanation}

\item It is not necessary to visualize the solid to compute its volume. Instead, the best approach is to sketch its base.

We can image the square cross-sections coming out of the page, but the key is to start by computing the area of the cross-section. The square cross-section has side length $s=2y$ and area
\[ 
 A = s^2 = 4y^2 .
\]
The differential slice of the solid has width $dx$ and differential volume
\[
    dV = A \, dx = 4y^2 \, dx .
\]

Before integrating, we'll need to get rid of the mixed variables and express the differential volume in terms of $x$ and $dx$. To do this we need to use the fact that the base is bounded by the circle with equation
\[
      x^2 + y^2 = a^2
\]
in the above coordinate system. So
\[
      y^2 = a^2 - x^2
\]
and the differential slice has volume
\begin{align*}
  dV & = 4y^2 \, dx \\
       &= 4(a^2-x^2)\, dx .
\end{align*}

We add these differential volumes to get the volume of the solid,
\begin{align*}
   V &= \int_{-a}^a 4(a^2-x^2)\, dx \\
      &= 8 \int_0^a (a^2-x^2)\, dx \\
      &= 8 \left( a^2x - \frac{1}{3}x^3 \right) \Big|_{x=0}^{x=a} \\
      &= \frac{16}{3}a^3 .
\end{align*}


\item Activate the folder in Line 1 above to see the cylinder that surrounds the solid. 

This cylinder has volume
\[
 W = (2  a) (\pi a^2) = 2\pi a^3  \sim 6.28 a^3.
\]
So the solid occupies
\[
  \frac{V}{W} = \frac{16}{6\pi} \sim 84.9\%
\]
the volume of the cylinder.

\begin{question} \label{QoFDerf323f}
Let $a,b>0$ be constants.

The base of a solid is the region bounded by the ellipse
\[
    \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.
\]
Cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are squares.

\begin{question} \label{Q88rew3efds}

The base of a tent is a regular hexagon with side length $a$ meters. Three poles bent into semicircles run between opposite vertices. Cross sections parallel to the base are regular hexagons having their vertices on the poles.
