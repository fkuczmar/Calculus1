Introduction to integral calculus.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

The \emph{differential} in Differential Calculus shares the same root as \emph{difference}, and \emph{calculus} the same root as \emph{compute}. Differential calculus is all about \emph{computing differences}. Expressed more simply, it is about \emph{subtraction}.

On the other hand, \emph{Integral Calculus} is about addition. \emph{Integral} shares the same root as \emph{integer} and comes from the Latin \emph{integratus}, the past participle of \emph{integrare}, to make whole.
