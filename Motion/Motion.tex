\begin{question}  \label{Q:4sdfdsfdellk}

Play the slider $u$ in the activity below to see the motion of a balloon. Use the animation to sketch graphs of

(a) the altitude of the balloon as a function of time.

(b) the balloon's rate of ascent as a function of time.

(c) Activate the folders in Lines 13 and 18 to see how you did.

\begin{question}  \label{QDfsdtegg}
The function
\[
     h = f(t) = 10 - \frac{1}{2}t^2 e^{-t/5} \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 30,
\]
expresses the altitude of a balloon (in thousands of feet) in terms of the number of hours since noon on August 31, 2023.

(a) When is the balloon at its minimum height? At its maximum height?

(b) When is the balloon ascending at the fastest rate? Descending at the fastest rate? 

\end{question}
