\section{Angles of Inclination}

\begin{question}  \label{QPdiftgerdf}
Find the measure of the acute (between $0$ and $\pi/2$) angle the tangent line to the curve
\[
     y = \ln | \sec \theta|
\]
at the point $(2\pi/7, \ln |\sec (2\pi/7)|)$ makes with the $x$-axis. Give an exact answer without using a calculator.

\begin{question}  \label{QJKDF3erdfsmdf}
Find the measure of the acute angle the tangent line to the curve
\[
    y = 4 \tan(x/20)
\]
makes with the $x$-axis at the points with $y$-coordinate $y=3$. Give an exact answer, fully simplified, without using a calculator.

\section{A Climber's Trail}

\begin{question} \label{QOIIdfsdftt444}
The function
\[
 h = f(s) =100+ 250s-10s^3 \, , \, 0\leq s \leq 5
\]
expresses the altitude (in meters) of a climber's trail in terms of the distance from the trailhead (in miles). Find the exact angle the trail makes with the horizontal one mile from the trailhead.

\section{A Hanging Chain}

\begin{question} \label{QJFefexxxwe}
Which of the following curves have the same shape as the curve
\[
    y = \sin\theta?
\]
Select all that apply.

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$y=2\sin\theta$}
\choice{$y=2\sin (2\theta)$}
\choice[correct]{$y=2\sin (\theta/2)$}
\choice{$y=0.2\sin (0.2\theta)$}
\choice[correct]{$y=0.2\sin (5\theta)$}
\end{selectAll}

Note: Two curves have the same shape if you can scale a photograph of one to get an exact copy of the other.

\end{question}

\begin{question} \label{iifkdeyq3y}
A chain of uniform density hanging under its own weight in a uniform gravitational field takes the shape of a the hyperbolic cosine function $y=\cosh x$ (we'll see why later in the course).

\begin{enumerate} 


\item All that's needed to describe a particular chain is to scale the size of the curve $y=\cosh x$ by some factor. Test this by dragging the slider $a$ in Line 6 to make the graph of the function
\[
     f(x) = -a + a\cosh(x/a)
\]
match the highlighted (orange) chain below.

\item What are the units of $a$? How do you know?

\item Using the value of $a$ from part (a), find the angle the cahin makes with the horizontal the points two meters above the low point of the chain. Give an exact expression, fully simplified, without using a calculator.
\end{enumerate}
