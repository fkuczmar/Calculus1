\begin{question} \label{EUERr3rDR}
The function 
\[
    r = f(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq  60 , 
\]
expresses a balloon's rate of ascent (measured in ft/min) in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Its graph is shown below.

The balloon is $1900$ feet high at 12:10pm.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write an expression for the balloon's height at 12:40pm.Then use the graph to approximate this height.

\item Write an expression for the balloon's height at 12:04pm.Then use the graph to approximate this height.

\item Find an expression for the function 
\[
         h=g(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 60, 
\]
that gives the balloon's height at time $t$ minutes past noon.
\end{enumerate}

The balloon is $3200$ feet high at 12:40pm.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ignore the graph and write an expression with a for the balloon's height at 12:30pm.Then use the graph to find this height.

\item Ignore the graph and write an expression for the balloon's height at 12:10pm.Then use the graph to find this height.

\item When is the balloon the same height as it is at 12:09pm?

\item When is the balloon $20$ feet higher than it is at 12:18pm?


\item Find an expression for the function 
\[
         h=g(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 60, 
\]
that gives the balloon's height at time $t$ minutes past noon.
