\begin{question} \label{Q43hhbnhhnnzzz}

A tree leans precariously with its trunk making an angle of $\phi = \pi/3$ radians with the ground. One end of a seven-foot ladder leans against the trunk, the other rests on the horizontal ground. We analyze how a small change in the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the base of the trunk changes the distance between the top of the ladder and the base of the trunk.

We'll let $u$ be the distance $OT$ between the top of the ladder and the base of the trunk (measured in feet) and  $s$ the distance $OB$ between the bottom of the ladder and the base of the trunk (also measured in feet).



We'll focus on the particular position of the ladder when the bottom end is $5$ feet from the trunk's base and the top end is $8$ feet \emph from the base \emph{as illustrated above}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use the slider $s$ approximate the derivative
\[
\frac{ds}{du}\Big|_{(s,u)\sim (5,8)} .
\]
Be sure to include units.

\item Find an equation that relates $s$ and $u$. Then activate the Folder in Line 20.

\item Find an expression for the derivative $ds/du$.

\item Use your expression for $ds/du$ to evaluate the derivative
\[
\frac{ds}{du}\Big|_{(s,u)\sim (5,8)} .
\]

\item Interpret the meaning of the derivative using the language of small changes.


\end{enumerate}
