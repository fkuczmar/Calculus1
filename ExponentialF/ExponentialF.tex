\section*{Relative Changes and Relative Rate of Change}
Relative changes and relative errors are often more meaningful than absolute changes and errors. For example, I might measure the distance from Shoreline's Central Market to the Richmond beach library to be $5$ km with an  error of at most $0.2$ km, while NASA might measure the between the earth and the moon on the first day of spring to be $384,400$ km with an error of at most $100$ km. The relative error in my measurement is at most
\[
  \frac{0.2 \text{ km} }{5 \text{ km}} = 0.04 = 4\% ,
\] 
while the relative error in NASA's measurement is at most
\[ 
   \frac{100 \text{ km} }{384,400 \text{ km}} \sim 0.00026 = 0.026\% .
\]
Relatively speaking, NASA's measurement was about 150 times more accutate than mine.

\begin{question}  \label{Qfnljhn}
At 10:00am the preices of Stock A and Stock B are both increasing at the rate of $(\$2/\text{share})/\text{hour}$. At 10:00am Stock A sells for $\$50$/share and Stock B for $\$10$/share. Compare the relative rates at which the share prices are changing at 10:00am.
\end{question}


\begin{question} \label{Q43tbbtt}
The function 
\[
      P = f(t) = 5 -3t + t^2 \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 4 , 
\]
expresses the price in $\$$/share of a stock in terms of the number of hours past 9am.

(a) At what relative rate is the price of the stock changing at 10am? 

(b) When is the share price increasing at a rate of $60\%$/hr?

(c) During what time interval is the price of the stock increasing?

(d) During what time interval is the relative rate of change in the price of the stock increasing?

\section*{Exponential Growth}
\begin{question}  \label{Qr435rhgnbh}
(a) What does it mean for a population to grow exponentially?

(b) Is it possible for a population to increase by $20\%$ every year and not grow exponentially?
\end{question}


\begin{question} \label{Qewrdfst5t}
Suppose between noon and 10pm a colony of bacteria grows exponentially. The population is 200,000 at noon and 242,200 at 1pm.

(a) Describe how the population grows. Keeping Question 2(b) in mind, is  your description sufficient?

(b) How might we find a complete description of the exponential growth?

(c) Determine the relative average growth rate between noon and 12:30pm. Between 1pm and 1:30pm. Over any half-hour time period. Use the slider $u$ in the graph below to intrepret these rates geometrically.

(d) Approximate the instantaneous relative growth rates in the population at noon, at 1pm, and at 2pm. Modify the definition of $v=u+1/2$ in the demonstration below and interpret these rates geometrically.

(e) Use limits to write an expression that gives the instantaneous growth rate at time $t$ hours past noon. What can you conclude? 

(f) Try to answer part (b) again.

\begin{question} \label{Qdcvbrtt}
One of the two functions graphed below is an exponential function. Which one? How do you know?
\end{question}



\section*{The Derivative as a Magnification Factor}
\begin{exploration}   \label{Ex:325gyt}

It sometimes helps to think of the derivative as a magnification factor that maps a small interval around an input to a function to a corresponding interval around the output.

(a) Use this idea for the function $y=f(x)$ graphed below to approximate the derivatives 
\[
    \frac{d}{dx} (f(x))\Big|_{x=4} \text{  and  } \,\, \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=5} .
\]

\section*{Differentiating the Exponential Function $e^x$}

\begin{exploration}

(a) Use the graph of the function $y=f(x)$ below to approximate the derivatives 
\[
    \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{y=k} \text{ for } k=1, 2, \ldots , 6.
\]
Note the above derivatives are evaluated at the \emph{outputs} of the function $f$. 

(b) What do  you notice?
