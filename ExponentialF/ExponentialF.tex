\section*{The Derivative as a Magnification Factor}
\begin{exploration}   \label{Ex:325gyt}

It sometimes helps to think of the derivative as a magnification factor that maps a small interval around an input to a function to a corresponding interval around the output.

(a) Use this idea for the function $y=f(x)$ graphed below to approximate the derivatives 
\[
    \frac{d}{dx} (f(x))\Big|_{x=4} \text{  and  } \,\, \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=5} .
\]

\section*{Differentiating the Exponential Function $e^x$}

\begin{exploration}

(a) Use the graph of the function $y=f(x)$ below to approximate the derivatives 
\[
    \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{y=k} \text{ for } k=1, 2, \ldots , 6.
\]
Note the above derivatives are evaluated at the \emph{outputs} of the function $f$. 

(b) What do  you notice?

\begin{question}  \label{Qdefrt4trt}
The function 
\[
    P = 400 e^t , 0\leq t \leq 2
\]
expresses the population (in thousands) of a colony of bacteria in terms of the number of hours past noon.

(a) What are the units of the factor $400$?

(b) What are the units of the exponent in the factor $e^t$? Be careful.

(c) Find the (instantaneous) growth rate of the population when there are 1,200,000 bacteria.

(d) Find the relative (instantaneous) growth rate when there are 1,200,000 bacteria.

(e) Find the  relative (instantaneous) growth rate at any time.

(f) Approximate the population $30$ seconds after there are 1,200,000 bacteria.

\begin{question}  \label{Qdfdsf4thn}
Let $k>0$ be a constant and let
\[
     f(x) = k e^x .
\]
For $a\in \mathbb{R}$ let point $P$ with coordinates $(a, f(a))$ be a curve on the curve$y=f(x)$. Let $Q$ be the point where the tangent line to the curve intersects the $x$-axis and let $R$ be the point with coordinates $(a,0)$

(a) Find the length of segment $\overline{QR}$.

(b) How is part (a) related to part (e) of the previous question?
