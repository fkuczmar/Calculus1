\begin{question}  \label{QdsadfKGDCCCC}
A spotlight in a circular dance hall of radius $r$ meters is located $b$ meters from the center of the hall. 

At some instant the light is rotating at the rate of $\omega$ rad/sec.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression for the speed of the light beam as it moves along the wall at this instant. Your expression should be in terms of $\omega$, $r$, $b$, and the angle $\theta$ marked below.

\item Check that your expression in  part (a) has the correct units.

\item Where is the spotlight on the wall when its speed is increasing at the greatest rate?

\end{enumerate}
