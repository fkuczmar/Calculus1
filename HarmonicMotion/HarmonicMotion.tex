Simple harmonic motion.

\maketitle

Suppose for this problem that the earth is a ball with uniform density of radius 4000 miles. Now imagine drilling a straight tunnel through the earth from the North Pole to the South Pole. 

A rock dropped from rest at the north pole would then oscillate in simple harmonic motion between the poles. This means we can think of the rock as being dragged along by a point moving around the earth at constant speed as illustrated below.
