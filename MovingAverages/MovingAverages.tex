\begin{question} \label{QPderRERglO}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Your average for the first four exams in a class is $90\%$. How would a score of $100\%$ on the fifth exam change your average?

\item $45$ minutes into a three hour car trip, your trip odometer reads $30$ miles and your speedometer reads $60$ miles/hour. Find the rate of change, with respect to time (measured in the number of hours since the start of your trip), in your average speed for the trip at this time.

\item Solve part (b) in general. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
