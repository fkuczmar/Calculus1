\begin{question} \label{Q54rghgeyghhg}

Part (a) of the following question is an important takeaway from this chapter. It is not necessary to answer this question now.

A rock is dropped near the surface of a planet without an atmosphere. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Through what fraction of its initial height does the rock fall during the last $1/10$ of the time it takes to hit the surface? Give a quick estimate.

\item What is the exact fraction? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


\begin{exploration}  \label{Qvbbtrg43444}

Play the slider $u$ in Line 1 of the desmos worksheet below to watch two motions. One is a rock falling to the surface of Mars when dropped from a height of $190$ feet above the surface. The other is a constant-speed motion.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the animation to sketch a graph of the function $s=g(t)$ that expresses the distance (in meters) of the rock from its starting point in terms of the number of seconds since the rock was released. Include the appropriate units and variable names on the axes.

\item Activate the folder \emph{Graph of distance function} in Line 17 above to see how you did.

\item Our aim now is to compute the (instantaneous) speed of the rock (in m/s) at time $t=u$ seconds. We'll assume that 
\[
      s = g(t) = 1.9t^2 \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 10.
\] 

Do this as follows.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression that gives the rock's average speed between times $t=u$ and $t=v$.

\item Evaluate the appropriate limit to find the speed of the rock at time $t=u$ seconds. Click the Hint tab above for help.

\begin{hint}

The speed at time $t=u$ is
\begin{align*}
    \frac{d\answer{s}}{d\answer{t}} \Big|_{\answer{t=u}} &=      \lim_{\answer{v}\to \answer{u}} \frac{\answer{1.9v^2-1.9u^2}}{v-\answer{u}}   \\
                                                       & = \lim_{\answer{v}\to \answer{u}} 1.9(\answer{v+u}) \\
                                                       & = 3.8u .
 \end{align*}
\end{hint}

\item Use the result of part (b) to find the rock's speed as it hits the ground.

\item Compare the rock's speed as it hits the ground with its average speed during the entire time of its fall.

\item Through approximately what fraction of the total distance of $190$ meters does the rock fall during the last second? Explain how this question is related to the previous one.

\item Compare the rock's speed at time $t=u$ with its average speed during the first $u$ seconds of its fall.

\item Use point-slope to find an equation of the tangent line to the curve $s=1.9t^2$ at the point $(u,1.9u^2)$. Enter this equation in Line 21 of the worksheet above.

The point-slope equation is
\[
     s = 1.9u^2 + \answer{3.8u} ( \answer{t} - \answer{u}) .
\]

\item Activate the folder \emph{Average speed} in Line 23 above. How is the slope of the tangent line related to the slope of the line $OP$?

\item Find the coordinates of the point where the tangent line intersects the horizontal axes. Enter these in Line 30 above.

The coordinates are
\[
  (t,s) = \left( \answer{\frac{u}{2}} , 0 \right) .
\]
