Play the slider $u$ in Line 1 of the desmos worksheet below to watch a rock as it falls to the surface of Mars when dropped from a height of $190$ feet above the surface.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the animation to sketch a graph of the function $s=g(t)$ that expresses the distance (in meters) of the rock from its starting point in terms of the number of seconds since the rock was released. Include the appropriate units and variable names on the axes.

\item Our aim now is to compute the (instantaneous) speed of the rock (in m/s) at time $t=u$ seconds. We'll assume that the function 
\[
      s = g(t) = 1.9t^2 \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 10,
\] 
expresses the distance (in meters) of the rock from its starting point in terms of the number of seconds since the rock was released from a height of $190$ meters.

Do this as follows.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression that gives the rock's average speed between times $t=u$ and $t=v$.

\item Evaluate the appropriate limit to find the speed of the rock at time $t=u$ seconds. Click the Hint tab above for help.

\begin{hint}

The speed at time $t=u$ is
\begin{align*}
    \frac{d\answer{s}}{d\answer{t}} \Big|_{\answer{t=u}} &=      \lim_{\answer{v}\to \answer{u}} \frac{\answer{1.9v^2-1.9u^2}}{v-\answer{u}}   \\
                                                       & = \lim_{\answer{v}\to \answer{u}} 1.9(\answer{v+u}) \\
                                                       & = 3.8u .
 \end{align*}
\end{hint}

\item Use the result of part (b) to find the rock's speed as it hits the ground.

\item Compare the rock's speed as it hits the ground with its average speed during the entire time of its fall.

\item Through what fraction of the total distance of $190$ meters does the rock fall during the last second? Explain how this question is related to the previous one.

\item Use point-slope to find an equation of the tangent line to the curve $s=1.9t^2$ at the point $(u,1.9u^2)$. Enter this equation in Line 21 of the worksheet above.

The point-slope equation is
\[
     s = 1.9u^2 + \answer{3.8u} ( \answer{t} - \answer{u}) .
\]

\item Compare the rock's speed at time $t=u$ with its average speed during the first $u$ seconds of its fall.
