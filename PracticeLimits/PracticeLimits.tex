\section{The Squaring Function and Its Inverse}

\begin{question}  \label{QPodfoitte43}
The function
\[
         A = f(s) \, , \, s\geq 0 ,
\]
expresses the area of a square (measured in meters) in terms of its side length (in meters).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression for the average rate of change in the area of a square with respect to its side length between side lengths $s=b$ and $s=w$ meters.

\item Use your expression from part (a) and the algebra of limits to find an expression for the derivative
\[
      \frac{dA}{ds}\Big|_{s=b}.
\]

\item Use the result of part (b) to evaluate the derivative
\[
   \frac{dA}{ds}\Big|_{s=5}.
\]

\item What are the units of the derivative in part (c).

\item Explain the meaning of the derivative (c) in terms of small changes.

\begin{explanation}
You should have found that
\[
    \frac{dA}{ds}\Big|_{s=5} = 10 \text{ ft}^2/\text{ft} .
\]

\end{explanation}

\end{enumerate}
