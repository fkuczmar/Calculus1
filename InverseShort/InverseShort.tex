\section{The Main Idea}

The main idea here is simple. That the derivative of the \emph{inverse} of a function is the \emph{reciprocal} of the function's derivative. Or expressed more succinctly, \emph{the derivative of the inverse is the reciprocal of the derivative}.

We don't really need to know much about calculus to understand why. 

\begin{question} \label {Qtyhhdhfdgfd}
Take for example, the function
\[
      G = f(s)  \, , \, 0\leq s\leq 20, 
\]
that expresses the number of gallons of gas in your car in terms of your distance from home. The distance is measured in miles along your route and the graph of the function is shown below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the slider $s$ above to approximate (with units) the derivative
\[
   \frac{dG}{ds}\Big|_{s=2} .
\]
Explain the derivative's meaning.

\item Use the slider $s$ above to approximate (with units) the derivative
\[
   \frac{ds}{dG}\Big|_{G=f(2)} .
\]
Explain the derivative's meaning.

\item Write an equation that expresses the relationship between the derivatives in parts (a) and (b). Explain why this relationship holds.

\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{Qttynmmbbb}
This question is a continuation of Question \ref{Qtyhhdhfdgfd}. Now we are given an expression
\[
   G = f(s)  = \frac{s^2}{2000} + \frac{23s}{1000} + \frac{1}{10} \, , \, 0\leq s\leq 20, 
\]
for the function $f$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use calculus to find an expression for the derivative $dG/ds$ and to compute the exact value of the derivative
\[
        \frac{dG}{ds}\Big|_{s=2} .
\]

\item Use the idea of Question \ref{Qtyhhdhfdgfd} to find an expression for the derivative $ds/dG$ and the exact value of the derivative
\[
   \frac{ds}{dG}\Big|_{G=f(2)} .
\]

\item For a more algebraic way to find an expression for the derivative $ds/dG$, we'll differentiate both sides of the equation
\[
    G =  \frac{s^2}{2000} + \frac{23s}{1000} + \frac{1}{10}
\]
with respect to $G$. Keeping in mind that this equation, for values of $s$ between $0$ and $20$, defines $s$ implicitly as a function of $G$ (why?). Then using the chain rule tells us that
\[
     \frac{dG}{dG} = \left( \frac{s+23}{1000} \right)  \left(\frac{ds}{dG} \right) .
\]
And solving for the derivative $ds/dG$ gives
\[
     \frac{ds}{dG} = \answer{\frac{1000}{s+23}} .
\]

\end{enumerate}
\end{question}




\section{Derivatives of Inverse Trig Functions}

The idea of computing the derivative of the inverse of a one-to-one function as illustrated above is simple. But if we require that the derivative of the inverse be expressed in terms of \emph{its independent variable}, the algebra can get a bit tricky.

\begin{example} \label{Ecbfghnbng}
Take for example the function
\[
     y = g(\theta) = \sin\theta.
\]

Now this function is \emph{not} one-to-one and so its inverse is not a function. But we can restrict the domain of $g$ to get a new function
\begin{equation}  
     y =f(\theta) = \sin\theta \, , \, -\pi/2 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2 , \label{Eq:ArcSine}
\end{equation}
that is one-to-one and that has the same range $\{y | -1 \leq y \leq 1\}$ as $g$. The inverse of this new function $f$ is the inverse sine function
\[
    \theta = f^{-1}(y) = \arcsin(y) = \sin^{-1}(y) .
\]

The function $\arcsin (y)$ gives the angle between $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$ whose sine is equal to $y$. The key to expressing its derivative
\[
  \frac{d\theta}{dy} = \frac{d}{dy}\left(  \arcsin y \right)
\]
in terms of $y$, is to express the derivative of the original function $y=f(\theta)$ in terms of its output $y=\sin\theta$.

Now
\[
     \frac{dy}{d\theta} = \frac{d}{d\theta} \left( \sin\theta \right) = \cos\theta .
\]
To express this derivative in terms of $y=\sin\theta$, we use the fact that 
\[
 \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1 .
\]
So 
\[
      \frac{dy}{d\theta} = \cos\theta = \pm \sqrt{1-\sin^2\theta} = \pm \sqrt{1-y^2}.
\]

To choose between $\pm$, we must remember that by the definition of the arcsine function (see equation (1)), 
\[
   \pi/2 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2 .
\]
This tells us that $\cos\theta \geq 0$. So we conclude that
\[
\frac{d}{dy}\left(  \arcsin y \right)  =\cos\theta = \sqrt{1-y^2}.
\]
\end{example}
