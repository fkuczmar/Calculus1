This course is listed as Calculus I in the catalogue, but it really should be called Differential Calculus. \emph{Differential} has the same root as \emph{difference} and \emph{calculus} the same root as \emph{calculate}. So this class is really about calculating differences, or more simply put it's about subtracting.

The central idea of this class is approximating the change in the output of a function given a small change in the input. Let's look at a few examples.

\section{Odometer Readings}

\begin{example} \label{Ex:ldfdtgjh5}
Suppose the function
\[
    s = f(t) , 0\leq t \leq 2 ,
\]
expresses the trip odometer reading (measured in miles) on your car in terms of the number of hours past noon during a two-hour trip. The graph of $f$  is shown below.

Our goal is to approximate the car's speed at 12:30pm.

\pskip

(a) Use the graph above to describe how the speed of the car varies over the two-hour period. Over what time intervals is the speed increasing? Decreasing? Explain your reasoning. Then play the Slider $u$ in Line 2 and use the animation of the motion to check if your description was accurate. Explain.

(b) To approximate the car's speed at 12:30pm, zoom in sufficiently close to point $P$ in the graph above to make the graph of $s=f(t)$ look like a line. Use the coordinates of point $P$ and a second point in the window far away from $P$ to estimate the slope of this line. How is the slope related to the car's speed at 12:30pm? Explain your reasoning.

(c) Use your approximation to write an equation of the line through $P$ with your slope from part (b). Use point-slope:
