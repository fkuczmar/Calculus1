Introduction to Differential Calculus

\maketitle


This course is listed as Calculus I in the catalogue, but it really should be called Differential Calculus. \emph{Differential} has the same root as \emph{difference} and \emph{calculus} the same root as \emph{calculate}. So this class is really about calculating differences, or more simply put it's about subtracting.
