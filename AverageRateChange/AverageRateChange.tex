With time as the independent variable, the derivative is most naturally interpreted as an instantaneous rate of change. Here are a few examples. %We'll start by reviewing average rates of change.

\begin{question}  \label{Q4ghg5df5yhhfg4tr4}
Due to a late-season frost in eastern Washington, the price of Cosmic Crisp apples is rising precipitously.

The function
\[
      N = f(t)  \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 8 ,                     %= -2t^3+7t^2-8t+8 \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2.2 ,
\]
expresses the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$ in terms of the number of hours past 9am on April 23, 2005. 

The graph of the function $h=f(t)$ is shown below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $b\in [0,8]$ be a constant. Interpret the meaning of the function
\[
   m(v) =  \frac{f(v)-f(b)}{v-b}
\]
in the context of this scenario. Include units. State the domain of the function as well.

\item Use the graph of the function $N=f(t)$ above and the slider $v$ on Line 4 to to sketch a rough graph of the function $r=m(v)$ when $b=5$. Label the axes with the appropriate variable names and units.

\item Activate the folder (avg. rate of change function) in Line 11 to check your graph of the function $r=m(v)$. 

\item Click on the appopriate points of the curve $r=m(v)$ to find the average rate of change (with respect to time) in the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$ between 

\begin{enumerate}
\item 11:00 am and 2:00 pm

\item 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm

Be sure to include units.

\end{enumerate}

\item Zoom in close enough near the missing point on the curve $r=m(v)$ to approximate the rate of change at 2pm in the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$  at 2:00pm.

\item Activate Line 1 (click on the circle icon) and the open the Table y clicking the \emph{right arrow} at the left of the line. Use it to guess the rate of change (with respect to time) in the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$  at 2:00pm.

\item Now suppose between 9am and 5pm the price of apples increases at a constant rate. Suppose also that the price is $\$2$/lb at 9am and $\$4$/lb at 2pm. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression for the function $N=f(t)$.

\item Find an expression for the function $r=m(v)$. Include the appropriate domain.

\item Use your expression for $m(v)$ and the algebra of limits to compute the rate of change at 2pm in the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$.

\item Compare the relative rate of change at 2pm in the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$ with the relative rate of change in the price at this time.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{question}  \label{Q4ghg5t4t4tr4}
The function
\[
      h = f(t)  \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2.2 ,                     %= -2t^3+7t^2-8t+8 \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2.2 ,
\]
expresses the height of a balloon (in hundreds of feet) in terms of the number of minutes past noon.

The graph of the function $h=f(t)$ is shown below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $a\in [0,2.2]$ be a constant. Interpret the meaning of the function
\[
   m(v) =  \frac{f(v)-f(a)}{v-a}
\]
in the context of this scenario. Include units. State the domain of the function as well.

\item Use the graph of the function $h=f(t)$ above and the slider $u$ to to sketch a rough graph of the function $r=m(v)$ when $a=2$. Label the axes with the appropriate variable names and units.

\item Activate the folder (avg. rate of change function) in Line 11 to check your graph of the function $r=m(v)$. 

\item Click on the appopriate points of the curve $r=m(v)$ to find the balloon's average rate of ascent between 

\begin{enumerate}
\item 12:00pm and 12:02pm

\item 12:01pm and 12:02mp
\end{enumerate}

\item Zoom in close enough near the missing point on the curve $r=m(v)$ to approximate the balloon's rate of ascent at 12:02pm.

\item Open the Table in Line 1 by clicking the \emph{right arrow} at the left of the line. Use it to guess the instantaneous rate of ascent at 12:02pm.

\item Now suppose
\[
   f(t) = -2t^3+7t^2-8t+8 .
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a simplified expression for the function $r=m(v)$. Include the appropriate domain.

\item Use your simplified expression to compute the balloon's rate of ascent at 12:02pm.

\begin{question}  \label{Qdfsa4555}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Drag the slider $u$ from $u=0$ to $u=1$ in Line 2 below. Then use the graph/animation of the stretching function
\[
   H = f(L) = 0.1 +0.5L + 0.1(L-1)^3 \, , \, 0\leq L \leq 3 ,
\]
to approximate the local stretching factor at $L=2$. Include units.

\item Use the graph of the same stretching function $H=f(L)$ show again below to graph (by hand) the function
\[
    r = m(v)
\]
that gives the average stretching factor of the portion of the band between lengths $L=v$ and $L=2$ meters. Label the axes with the appropriate variable names and units. Then activate the average rate of change folder in Line 11 to see how you did.
