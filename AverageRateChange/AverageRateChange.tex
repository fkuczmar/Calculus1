With time as the independent variable, the derivative is most naturally interpreted as an instantaneous rate of change. Here are a few examples. %We'll start by reviewing average rates of change.

\begin{question}  \label{Q4ghg5df5yhhfg4tr4}
Due to a late-season frost in eastern Washington, the price of Cosmic Crisp apples is rising precipitously.

The function
\[
      N = f(t)  \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 8 ,                     %= -2t^3+7t^2-8t+8 \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2.2 ,
\]
expresses the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$ in terms of the number of hours past 9am on April 23, 2005. 

The graph of the function $h=f(t)$ is shown below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $b\in [0,8]$ be a constant. Interpret the meaning of the function
\[
   m(v) =  \frac{f(v)-f(b)}{v-b}
\]
in the context of this scenario. Include units. State the domain of the function as well.

\item Use the graph of the function $N=f(t)$ above and the slider $v$ on Line 4 to to sketch a rough graph of the function $r=m(v)$ when $b=5$. Label the axes with the appropriate variable names and units.

\item Activate the folder (avg. rate of change function) in Line 11 to check your graph of the function $r=m(v)$. 

\item Click on the appopriate points of the curve $r=m(v)$ to find the average rate of change (with respect to time) in the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$ between 

\begin{enumerate}
\item 11:00 am and 2:00 pm

\item 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm

Be sure to include units. Note that because of the different  scale on the vertical axis for the function $r=m(v)$, you will need to divide the $r$-coordinates by $10$.

\end{enumerate}

\item Zoom in close enough near the missing point on the curve $r=m(v)$ to approximate the rate of change at 2pm in the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$  at 2:00pm.

\item Open the Table in Line 1 by clicking the \emph{right arrow} at the left of the line. Use it to guess the rate of change (with respect to time) in the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$  at 2:00pm.

\item Now suppose between 9am and 5pm the price of apples increases at a constant rate. Suppose also that the price is $\$2$/lb at 9am and $\$4$/lb at 2pm. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression for the function $N=f(t)$.

\item Find an expression for the function $r=m(v)$. Include the appropriate domain.

\item Use your expression for $m(v)$ and the algebra of limits to compute the rate of change at 2pm in the number of pounds of apples you can buy with $\$36$.

\item Compare at 2pm the relative rate of change in the number of pounds of apples you can buy and$\$36$ with the relative rate of change in the price.

\begin{question}  \label{Q4gdfetdsfsdfhfg4tr4}
The function
\[
      g = f(v)  \, , \, 10\leq v \leq 55 ,                     %= -2t^3+7t^2-8t+8 \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2.2 ,

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $b\in [10,55]$ be a constant. Interpret the meaning of the function
\[
   m(v) =  \frac{f(v)-f(b)}{v-b}
\]
in the context of this scenario. Include units. State the domain of the function as well.

\item Use the graph of the function $g=f(v$ above and the slider $v$ on Line 4 to to sketch a rough graph of the function $r=m(v)$ when $b=20$. Label the axes with the appropriate variable names and units.

\item Activate the folder (avg. rate of change function) in Line 12 to check your graph of the function $r=m(v)$. 

\item Click on the appopriate points of the curve $r=m(v)$ to find the average rate of change (with respect to speed) in the fuel consumption rate between speeds of  

\begin{enumerate}
\item 15 miles/hour and 20 miles/hour

\item 20 miles/hour and 30 miles/hour

Be sure to include units. Note that because of the different  scale on the vertical axis for the function $r=m(v)$, you will need to divide the $r$-coordinates by $10$.

\end{enumerate}

\item Zoom in close enough near the missing point on the curve $r=m(v)$ to approximate the rate of change (with respect to speed) in the rate of fuel consuption at a speed of $20$ miles/hr.

\item Open the Table in Line 1 by clicking the \emph{right arrow} at the left of the line. Use it to guess the rate of change (with respect to speed) in the  rate of fuel consuption at a speed of $20$ miles/hr.

\item Now suppose between speeds of $10$ miles/hour and $55$ miles/hour that the car's gas mileage is a linear function of its speed. Suppose also that the car gets $25$ miles/gal at at a speed of $20$ miles/hour and $35$ miles/gal at a speed of $40$ miles/hour.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression for the function $g=f(t)$. Note: This is not a linear function.

\item Find an expression for the function $r=m(v)$. Include the appropriate domain.

\item Use your expression for $m(v)$ and the algebra of limits to compute the rate of change (with respect to speed) in the rate of fuel consuption at a speed of $20$ miles/hr.
