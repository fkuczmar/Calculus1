\section*{Differentiating Polynomials}

\begin{question}  \label{Qdst4hbbh}
(a) Use the algebra of limits to find an expression for the derivative 
\[
     \frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) =   \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^5 \right)
\]
of the function $f(x)=x^5$.

(b) Use the result of part (a) to find an expression for the derivative
\[
    \frac{d}{dx}(f^{-1}(x)) =   \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^{1/5} \right)
\]
of the function $f^{-1}(x) = x^{1/5}$. And use set-builder notation to state the domains of $f^{-1}(x)$ and its derivative. 

(c) Use the result of part (a) and the algebra of limits to find an expression for the derivative
\[
    \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{f(x)} \right) =   \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^{-5} \right)
\]
of the function $1/f(x) = x^{-5}$.

(d) Use the results of parts (a)-(c) to find equations of the tangent lines to the three curves $y=f(x)$, $y=f^{-1}(x)$, and $y=1/f(x)$ at the point $(1,1)$. Graph the curves and their tangent line in Desmos to check your work.

\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Qdsferewg}
(a) Use the results of Question 1 to make a conjecture about the derivative
\[
     \frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) =   \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^n \right)
\]
of the function $f(x)=x^n$.

(b) What do you get for the derivative when $n=0$? When $n=1$? Are these results correct? Explain.

\]
and
\[
    \frac{d}{dx} \left(a f(x) + b  \right)
\]
for constants $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$?

(d) Make up your own scenario that suggests how to compute the derivative

\]
of the sum of two functions.

The function
\[
      h = f(t) = 5 -2t -\frac{t^2}{4} + t^3 \, , \, -1\leq t \leq 1.8 ,
\]
expresses the height (in thousands of feet) of a balloon in terms of the number of hours past noon.

(a) Find the balloon's average rate of ascent between 11:00am and 11:30am.

(b) Is the balloon rising or falling at 1:00pm? At what rate? Use the graph of the function $h=f(t)$ below to approximate the rate. Then compute the exact rate.

(c) When is the balloon descending at the rate of $1000$ ft/hour? Use the sliders $m$ anb $b$ below to approximate the time(s). Then compute the exact time(s).

(d) Use the graph below to approximate when the balloon is descending at the fastest rate. Approximate this rate from the graph. Then compute the exact time and rate.

(e) Use the graph below to approximate when the balloon is at its lowest point. Then compute the exact time.

(f) Use the graph below to approximate when the balloon is at its highest point between 11am and 1:36pm. Then compute the exact time.

\begin{question} \label{Qdsfsadgt4e}
The function 
\[
   G = f(s) = \frac{11}{5} +\frac{1}{5000}\left( s^3-50s^2+300s \right) , \, 3\leq s \leq 28 ,
\]
expresses the number of gallons of gas in your car in terms of your distance from home. The distance is measured in miles along your route.

\href{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ilvkmqyzyw}{151: Gas as a Function of Distance}

(a) Use the graph of the function $f$ shown above to determine if you are driving toward or away from home. Explain your reasoning.

(b) Use the graph to approximate your gas mileage at the moment you are $20$ miles from home. Then compute the exact gas mileage.

(c) Use the graph to approximate an interval beginning or ending when you are $20$ miles from home over which your average gas mileage is equal to you gas mileage at the moment you are $20$ miles from home. Then compute the exact interval.

(d) Sensors on your car measure both the (instantaneous) gas mileage and the number of gallons of gas in your tank at each instant. A computer then uses these measurements to estimate the number of additional miles you can drive before running out of gas. Use this idea to find a function 
\[
  m =g(s) \, , \, 3\leq s \leq 28 ,
\]
that expresses the number of miles you can drive before running out of gas (assuming your gas mileage remains constant for the remainder of your trip) in terms of your distance from home. Explain your reasoning. 

\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{Qdet5h5t5}
(a) Make up your own \emph{quadratic} function
\[
  v = f(G)  = aG^2 + bG +c,
\]
with $a$,$b$, and $c$ all  not equal to zero, that expresses the speed of a car (measured in miles/hour) in terms of its gas mileage (measured in miles/gallon). Be sure to include a domain. Explain why you think your function is reasonable.

(b) Compute the derivative $dv/dG$ and evaluate it at a spefic gas mileage. Include units.

(c) Evaluate the derivative $dv/dG$ at a specific gas mileage and its meaning. Include units in your explanation.

(d) Use your function from part (a) to find a function
\[
    r = h(G)
\]
that expresses the rate (in gal/hr) at which the car burns gas in terms of its gas mileage (in miles/gal).  Explain your logic thoroughly.

(e) Evaluate $h(G)$ at the same gas mileage, say $G_0$, you used in part (c). Compare the units of $h(G_0)$ and the derivative $dv/dG\Big|_{G=G_0}$. Are these two numbers related? What does this tell you about simplifying the units of a derivative?

(f) Use the ideas of this chapter (ie. derivatives of polynomials, and nothing beyond) to find an expression for the derivative
$dr/dG$ .

(g) What are the units of the derivative $dr/dG$? 

(h) Evalute the derivative $dr/dG$ at a specific gas mileage and explain its meaning. Include units in your explanation.
