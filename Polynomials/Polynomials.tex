\section*{Differentiating Polynomials}

\begin{question}  \label{Qdst4hbbh}
(a) Use the algebra of limits to find an expression for the derivative 
\[
     \frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) =   \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^5 \right)
\]
of the function $f(x)=x^5$.

(b) Use the result of part (a) to find an expression for the derivative
\[
    \frac{d}{dx}(f^{-1}(x)) =   \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^{1/5} \right)
\]
of the function $f^{-1}(x) = x^{1/5}$. And use set-builder notation to state the domains of $f^{-1}(x)$ and its derivative. 

(c) Use the result of part (a) and the algebra of limits to find an expression for the derivative
\[
    \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{f(x)} \right) =   \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^{-5} \right)
\]
of the function $1/f(x) = x^{-5}$.

(d) Use the results of parts (a)-(c) to find equations of the tangent lines to the three curves $y=f(x)$, $y=f^{-1}(x)$, and $y=1/f(x)$ at the point $(1,1)$. Graph the curves and their tangent line in Desmos to check your work.

\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Qdsferewg}
(a) Use the results of Question 1 to make a conjecture about the derivative
\[
     \frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) =   \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^n \right)
\]
of the function $f(x)=x^n$.

(b) What do you get for the derivative when $n=0$? When $n=1$? Are these results correct? Explain.

\end{question}


\begin{question}   \label{Qergh55}
(a) Suppose one giraffe is always twice as tall as another. What can you say about their growth rates at any instant?

(b) Suppose one giraffe is always two feet taller than another. What can you say about their growth rates at any instant?

(c) What do parts (a) and (b) suggest about how to compute the derivatives
\[
   \frac{d}{dx} \left( f(x) + b  \right) ,
\]
\[
   \frac{d}{dx} \left(a f(x) \right) ,
\]
and
\[
    \frac{d}{dx} \left(a f(x) + b  \right)
\]
for constants $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$?

(d) Make up your own scenario that suggests how to compute the derivative
\[
   \frac{d}{dx} \left( f(x) + g(x)  \right) 
\]
of the sum of two functions.

\begin{question}  \label{Qerdfggg}
Let
\[
     y = f(x) = a x^2

\begin{question}  \label{Qdfgbbvvd}
In the absense of air resistance, a rock released from rest near the surface of the earth falls $s=16t^2$ feet during the first $t$ seconds of its fall.

Compare the speed of the rock when it hits the ground with the average speed of the rock during the entire time interval of its fall.

\begin{question}  \label{Qwerdfggg}
(a) The demonstration below shows two normal lines to a parabola and their point of intersection $P$. What do you think happens to $P$ as point $B$ approaches $A$? Answer this question \emph{without} dragging the slider $b$.

(b) Now drag the slider $b$ near $a=2$ and observe what happens to point $P$. Were you correct?

The parabola has equation $y=x^2/4$, point $A$ has coordinates $(2,1)$, and point $B$ has coordinates $(b,b^2/4)$.

expresses the height (in thousands of feet) of a balloon in terms of the number of hours past noon.

(a) Find the balloon's average rate of ascent between 11:00am and 11:30am.

(b) Is the balloon rising or falling at 1:00pm? At what rate? Use the graph of the function $h=f(t)$ below to approximate the rate. Then compute the exact rate.

(c) When is the balloon descending at the rate of $1000$ ft/hour? Use the sliders $m$ anb $b$ below to approximate the time(s). Then compute the exact time(s).

(d) Use the graph below to approximate when the balloon is descending at the fastest rate. Approximate this rate from the graph. Then compute the exact time and rate.

(e) Use the graph below to approximate when the balloon is neither ascending nor descending. Then compute the exact times.

(f) Use the graph below to approximate when the balloon is neither ascending nor descending. Then compute the exact times.
