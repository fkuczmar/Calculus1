\section{Rubber Band Calculus}

Think of the $x$-axis as an elastic band that can be stretched or compressed, and a function $f : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ as a deformation of this band. %For example, the function $f(x)= 2x$ stretches the band about the origin by a factor of two. As illustrated in Figure1, the stretching transforms a set of uniformly spaced marks to a set of marks spaced twice as far apart. Reversing the arrows gives a representation of the inverse function

For example, imagine a thin elastic band of length $4$ meters running along the horizontal $L$-axis from $L=0$ meters to $L=4$ meters.  Now hold the left end fixed and $L=0$ and stretch the right end to $L=8$. Then the function
\[
      H = g(L) = 2L \, , \, 0\leq L \leq 4 ,
\]
describes that stretching action. It takes as an input the distance (in meters) of a point on the band from the origin and returns as an output the distance between the origin and the corresponding point on the stretched band. The exploration below shows this stretching action.

\begin{exploration} \label{Ex:98f3rgafgbb}

The average rate of change of the function,
\[
      H = g(L) = 2L \, , \, 0\leq L \leq 4 ,
\]
between points $L=a$ and $L=b$ meters from the origin,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta L} &= \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\
                                       &= \frac{\answer{2(b-a)}}{b-a} \\
                                       &= \answer{2},
\end{align*}
is what we'll call the \emph{global stretching factor}. Any two points on the stretched band are twice as far apart as they were on the unstretched band.

\begin{question}  \label{Q:LDJJNMDesd}

\item Find an expression for the inverse function
\[
      L = f^{-1}(H).
\]
Include a domain. 

\item Interpret the inverse function as a deformation of a thin elastic band. What is the global stretching factor for this function?

\section{A Non-Linear Stretching Function}
Here's an example of a non-linear stretching function. Now the stretching factor is \emph{not} constant. Instead, we need to talk about a \emph{local} stretching factor, one that varies from point to point. 

\begin{exploration} \label{ExLdfdfthyhhhf}
Drag the slider $u$ in Line 2 below from $u=0$ to $u=1$ to illustrate the stretching action.

\end{exploration}

\begin{question} \label{Q:9887dfsdfdsf}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the animation above to approximate the local stretching factor at the point $L\sim 3.1$ meters from the origin on the unstretched band. Explain your reasoning.

\item Drag slider $m$ in Line 4 above to approximate the where the band remains relaxed (ie. neither in tension or in compression). Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


We can also approximate the local stretching factor at $L=3.1$ meters by looking at the graph of the function $H=f(L)$. The stretching function in Exploration 3 is
\[
      H = f(L) = 4 - 4\cos (L/2) \, , \, 0\leq L \leq 2\pi.
\]

\begin{exploration} \label{ExLtegfgfgyhhhf}
Drag the slider $u$ in Line 2 below from $u=0$ to $u=1$ to illustrate the stretching action and change the graph.
