\section{Limits and Tangent Lines}

\begin{example}  \label{Ex:9uudfg9}
Let
\[
     g(x) = \frac{9-x^2}{x-3} .
\]
(a) Evaluate each of the following expressions.

\pskip

(i) $g(7)$

(ii) $\lim_{x\to 7} g(x)$

(iii) $g(3)$

(iv) $\lim_{x\to 3} g(x)$

\pskip

(b) Simplify and then graph the function $g(x)$.

(c) Interpret the expressions in part (a) geometrically by considering the graph of the function $f(x)=9-x^2$.

\section{Gas Mileage}

\begin{example}  \label{Ex:34t45rtg}
Suppose that between speeds of $30$ miles/hour and $70$ miles/hour the gas mileage of a car is a quadratic function of its speed. 
Suppose also that the car gets a maximum of $42$ miles/gal at a speed of $50$ miles/hour and that the car gets $38$ miles/gallon at a speed of $40$ miles/hour.

(a) Find an expression for the function
\[
    G = f(v) \, , \, 30\leq v \leq 70 ,
\]
that gives the gas mileage (in miles/gal) in terms of the speed (in miles/hour).

(b) Give numerical  and graphical evidence that either supports or refutes the claim that a small change in the car's speed at $60$ miles/hour gives an approximately proportional change in its gas mileage.

(c) Use the results of part (b) to approximate the proportionality constant. What are its units?

(d) Use the algebra of limits to find the exact value of the proportionality constant.

(e) Explain the meaning of the proportionality constant.

(f) Approximate the change
\[
    \Delta G = g - f(60)
\]
in gas mileage in terms of the change
\[
  \Delta v = v - 60
\]
in the car's speed.

(g) Use part (f) to approximate the speed at which the car gets $36$ miles/gallon. 

(h) Would you expect your approximation in part (g) to be greater or less than the actual speed? Explain your reasoning with a graph.

(i) Simplify the units of the proportionality constant. What might these units suggest about a way to interpret the constant?

(j) At what rate (in gal/hr) does the car burn gas at a speed of $60$ miles/hour? 

(k) How is the rate in part (j) related to the proportionality constant?
