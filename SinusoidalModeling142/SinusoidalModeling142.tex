\begin{question} \label{Qhhjklfghjfd}
Suppose that during a five-day period, beginning at midnight Monday morning, the depth of the water at the Edmond's Pier is a sinusoidal function of time.

Suppose also that a low tide of $7$ feet occurs at 1:00am Monday morning and that the following high tide of $23$ feet occurs at 6:45am that same morning.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch by hand a graph of the function
\[
   h = f(t)
\] 
that expresses the depth of the water (in feet) as a function of the number of hours since midnight, Monday morning.

\item Find an expression for the above function. Include a domain.

\item Find all times during the week when the water is $10$ feet deep. Give exact times. Do not use a calculutor.

\item Approximate the clock times (to the nearest minute) on Friday when the water is $10$ feet deep.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{question}  \label{Qgghghnbnvxbvvb}
Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve
\[
   x^3\sin(5y) + 4e^{xy} = 4x
\]
at the point $(1,0)$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show all work.

\item Use the Leibniz notation for derivatives and their evaluations.

\item Include a brief explanation with your work.

\item End with a concluding sentence.
\end{enumerate}
