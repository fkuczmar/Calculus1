\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a function that express the length of the ladder (measured in feet) in terms of the angle the ladder makes with the ground. Include an appropriate domain.

\item Use part (a) to express the length of the shortest such ladder in terms of $a$ and $b$. Justify your assertion. 

\item Check that your expression has the correct units.

\end{enumerate}

Work in general and \emph{not} with the particular values of $a$ and $b$ in the worksheet above.
