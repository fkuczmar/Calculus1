\section*{Astroids}


\begin{question}  \label{QPDDFDFgg}
(a) The coordinate axes cut out a segment from the tangent line to the curve
\[
     x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}= 5
\]
at the point $P(8,1)$. Find the length of that segment. Do this by using implicit differentiation to help find an equation of the tangent line at $P$ and go from there. But first show that $P$ lies on the curve.

(b) As a bug crawls around the above curve and passes the point $P(8,1)$, it is moving away from the $x$-axis at the rate of $4$ cm/sec. Is the bug moving toward or away from the $y$-axis at this time? At what rate?  

(c) Find the slope of the tangent line in part (a) without using implicit differentiation.

%(c) Use geometry to find  the length of the segment cut out by the coordinate axes from the tangent line to the same curve 
%at the points where the curve intersects the line $y=x$.

%(d) Comments? Conjectures?


\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Q:LLKKKMM}
(a) Use implicit differentiation to show that segments cut by the coordinate axes from the tangent lines to the astroid
\[
   x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = a^{2/3}
\]
all have the same length. Here $a>0$ is a constant.

(b) Prove the same result by using trigonometric functions to parameterize the astroid.

\section*{Ellipses and Related Curves}

\begin{question}  \label{Q:4bbfdellk}
(a) Use implicit differentiation to find an equation of the tangent line to the ellipse 
\[
   \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
at the point $P$ with coordinates $(x_0, y_0)$. Here $a$, $b$ are positive constants.

(b) Input your equation from part (a) on Line 3 of the desmos worksheet below. Drag point $P$ to check your equation is correct.

(c) Solve part (c) again \emph{without} calculus by considering a composition of transformations that takes the circle
\[
       x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
to the ellipse in part (a).

An ellipse through the point $P(0,b)$ has focal points $F_1$ at the origin and $F_2$ at the point $A(a,0)$.

\section*{The Sliding Ladder}

\begin{question}  \label{QMMnd6793}
A tree leans precariously with its trunk making an angle of $\phi = \pi/3$ radians with the ground. One end of a ladder leans against the trunk, the other rests on the horizontal ground. You slide the bottom end of the ladder at random.

(a) Find all possible angles the ladder makes with the ground when the top end of the ladder is moving four times as fast as the bottom end. Characterize each angle in one of two ways:

(i) One end of the ladder is moving toward the trunk's base and the other end away from the base.

(ii) Both ends of the ladder are either moving toward or way from the trunk's base.

Give exact angles. Then use a calculator to approximate their radian measures to the nearest hundredth.

(b) Use the animation below to check that your answers are reasonable. Explain.

\begin{question}  \label{Q:er43455}
The function
\[
    h = f(\delta) = \frac{24}{\pi} \arccos(-\tan\phi \tan\delta) \, , \, -\pi/2+\phi < \delta < \pi/2-\phi ,
\]
expresses the number of hours of daylight per day at latitude $\phi$ in terms of the declination of the sun. The declination of the sun ($\delta$) is the angle the sun's rays make with the plane of the equator, taken to be positive between the spring and fall equinoxes in the northern hemisphere. The latitude $\phi$, $-\pi/2 \leq \phi \leq \pi/2$, is positive at points in the northern hemipshere.

\section*{Waves}

\begin{question}   \label{Q:DFLDFDFGggg}
The function
\begin{equation}  \label{Eq:Wave1}
      y= f(x,t) = a \sin (kx - \omega t) , t\geq 0,
\end{equation}
describes a wave on a string. The functions expresses the displacement (in meters) of a point on the string in terms of the position $x$ (in meters) of the point and time $t$, measured in seconds since the motion began.

(a) Experiment with the sliders $k$, $\omega$, in the demonstration below, playing the slider $u$ ($u$ is just another name for $t$). Summarize your observations. In particular, be sure to turn off Line 1 to be better able to see the motion of the individual points of the string.

(b) What are the units of $k$ and $\omega$? How do you know?

(c) Find an expression for the wavelength $\lambda$ in terms of $k$, $\omega$.

(d) Find an expression for the period of oscillation $T$ in terms of $k$, $\omega$.
 
(e) Hold $y$ constant and differentiate each side of equation (\ref{Eq:Wave1}) with respect to $t$ to find an expression for the speed of the wave. Turn on the graph in Line 9. Explain the logic behind the computation.
