\section*{Discussion Questions}

\begin{question}  \label{Q:dsftr4tr656t}
Which of the following equations define $y$ implicty as a function of $x$ in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the given point? Supplement your reasoning with a graph of each relation.

(a) $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ near the point $(4,-3)$

(b) $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ near the point $(0,-5)$

(c) $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ near the point $(-5,0)$

(d) $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 1$ near the point $(1,1)$.

(e) $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 3$ near the point $(1,2)$.

(f) $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 3$ near the point $(2,1)$.

\end{question}

\section*{Some Problems}

\begin{question}  \label{Q:4bbfdellk}
(a) Find an equation of the form 
\[
   \frac{x^2}{A^2} + \frac{y^2}{B^2} = 1
\]
of an ellipse through the point $P$ with coordinates $(a,b)$. Assume $ab\neq 0$.

(b) Input your equation from part (a) on Line 2 of the desmos worksheet below. Drag point $P$ to check your equation is correct.

(c) Find an equation of the tangent line to the ellipse in part (a) at the point $P$.

(d) Input your equation from part (c) on Line 4 in the desmos worksheet below. Drag point $P$ to check your equation is correct.

(e) Solve part (c) again \emph{without} calculus by considering a composition of transformations that take the circle
\[
       x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
to the ellipse in part (a).

\begin{question}  \label{Q:LLKKKMM}
(a) Use implicit differentiation to show that segments cut by the coordinate axes from the tangent lines to the astroid
\[
   x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = a^{2/3}
\]
all have the same length. Here $a>0$ is a constant.

(b) Prove the same result by using trigonometric functions to parameterize the astroid.
