Let $b,h>0$ be constants with units of meters and let $a=b/2$.

Suppose the curve $y=cx^8$ passes through the point $A$ with coordinates $(b/2,h) = (a,h)$. We wish to express the area of the shaded region below bounded by the curve and the line $y=h$ in terms of its base $b$ and height $h$. Do this as follows.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Express $c$ in terms of $a$ and $h$.

\item Express the area of the region first in terms of $a$ and $h$, and then in terms of $b$ and $h$.

\item Check that your expression for the area has the correct units. 

\item Interpret  your expression for the area geometrically. Does it seem reasonable? Compare it with the area of a triangle and with the area of a rectangle.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{explanation}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $y=cx^2$ be an equation of the parabola. Then since the point $(a,h)$ lies on the parabola
\[
  h = ca^2
\]
and 
\[
 c = \frac{h}{a^2} .
\]
So the parabola has equation
\[
   y = \frac{h}{a^2}x^2.
\]
 
The left and right endpoints of a horizontal slice $AB$ of the region share the same $y$-coordinate. Call it $y$. Since the left endpoint $A(x,y)$ lies on the parabola, 
\[
    x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{ya^2}{h}} .
\]
But because $A$ lies in the first quadrant, $x\geq 0$ and $A$ has coordinates
\[
       \left(  \sqrt{\frac{ya^2}{h}} , y \right) .
\]

To express the $x$-coordinate of the right endpoint $B$ in terms of $y$, we need an equation of the tangent line to the parabola at the point $P(a,h)$. 

The slope of this tangent line is
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left(   \frac{h}{a^2}x^2 \right) \Big|_{x=a}    &= \frac{2h}{a^2}x  \Big|_{x=a}  \\
                                                      &= \frac{2h}{a} .
\end{align*}

So an equation of the tangent line is
\[
 y = h +\frac{2h}{a} \left(  x - a \right) = \frac{2h}{a}x - h 
\]
and $B$ has coordinates
\[
   \left(\frac{a}{2h}y + \frac{a}{2}, y \right).
\]

Now the differential recangle $AB$ has length
\[
   \frac{a}{2h}y + \frac{a}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{ya^2}{h}} ,
\]
width $dy$ and area
\[
    dA = \left( \frac{a}{2h}y + \frac{a}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{ya^2}{h}} \right) \, dy .
\]

Finally, the area of the region bounded by the $x$-axis, the parabola, and the tangent line at $(a,h)$ is
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^h \left( \frac{a}{2h}y + \frac{a}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{ya^2}{h}} \right) \, dy &= \left(    \frac{a}{4h}y^2 + \frac{a}{2}y - \frac{2}{3} \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{h}} y^{3/2} \right)\Big|_{y=0}^{y=h} \\
                                                     &= \frac{ah}{4} + \frac{ah}{2} - \frac{2ah}{3} \\
                                                      &= \frac{1}{12} ah .
\end{align*}

\end{enumerate}
\end{explanation}
