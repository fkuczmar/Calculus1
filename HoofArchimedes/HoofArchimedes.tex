\begin{question} \label{QKDdfdeFMReR}
A solid circular cylinder of radius $a$ and height $h$ is sliced by a plane passing through a diameter of the base and intersecting the top of the cylinder in exactly one point. The plane cuts the cylinder into two pieces. Our goal here is to find an expression in $h$ and $a$ for the volume of the lower (smaller) piece.

We'll determine the volume of the lower piece (the hoof of Archimedes) by taking slices perpendicular to the coordinate axes . Turn off the folder in Line 2 and activate the appropriate folder in Lines 5, 13, or 22 if you need help visualizing the cross sections.

Slice the solid 
\begin{enumerate}
\item perpendicular to the $x$-axis (activate the folder in Line 5),

\item perpendicular to the $y$-axis (activate the folder in Line 13), and

\item perpendicular to the $z$-axis (activate the folder in Line 22).
\end{enumerate} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check that your expression for the volume is dimensionally correct.

\item What fraction of the original cylinder does the hoof occupy? Activate the folder in Line 33 to see the cylinder.
\end{enumerate}
