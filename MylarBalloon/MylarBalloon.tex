\begin{question} \label{QKDFeef343rfr3}

Let $a>0$ be a constant with units of meters and let
\[
   f(x) = \int_x^a \frac{u^2}{\sqrt{a^4-u^4}} \, du .
\]

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find the coordinates of the $x$-intercept of the curve $y=f(x)$.

\item Find the exact coordinates of the $y$-intercept. Then make a substitution to express the $x$-intercept as a multiple of $a$. Then use Line 3 in the worksheet above to approximate the multiple. 

%Express the coordinates of the $x$ intercept of the curve $y=f(x)$ as some multiple of $a$. Use a Riemann sum with $1000$ equal subintervals to approximate the multiple.

%\item Express the exact and approximate coordinates of the $y$-intercept in terms of $a$.

\item Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve $u=f(x)$ at the point where the line $x=a/2$ intersects the curve. Enter this equation in Line 4 above. Use the point-slope equation of a line, not slope-intercept.

\item Find an expression for the area bounded by the curve $y=f(x)$ and the $y$-axis. Activate the \emph{Hint} folder in Line 1 of the worksheet above for a hint. 

\item Compare the area in part (d) with the area of the surrounding rectangle. Does the ratio seem reasonable?

\item Activate the folder \emph{Rectangle} in Line 5. Compare the area of this rectangle with the area in part (d).

\begin{question} \label{QKDfervfdfe}
Rotate two copies of the rectangular elastica of Question 1 about the $y$-axis and you get a surface that models a mylar balloon.
