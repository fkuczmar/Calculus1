\section{Purchasing Power}

\begin{question} \label{Qdgvvbrtghgygrert}
This problem investigates how a small change in the price of apples would affect the number of pounds we can buy with $\$10$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item We'll start by finding a function
\[
       n = f(p) \, , \, p>0 ,
\]
that expresses the number of pounds of apples we can buy with $\$10$ in terms of the price (measured in dollars/pound).

The function is
\[
       n = f(p) = \answer{10/p} ,\, p>0.
\]

\item Would you expect the derivative $dn/dp$ to be postive, negative, or zero? Explain.

\item Use limits to find an expression for the derivative
\[
    \frac{dn}{dp} \Big|_{p=a}.
\]

The derivative is (click the Hint tab above for help)

\begin{hint}
\begin{align*}
          \frac{dn}{dp} \Big|_{p=a} &= \lim_{\answer{p\to a}} \frac{1}{p-a} \left( f(p)-f(a) \right)  \\
                                                 &=  \lim_{\answer{p\to a}} \frac{1}{p-a} \left(\frac{10}{p} - \frac{10}{a} \right)  \\
                                                 &=  \lim_{\answer{p\to a}} \frac{10}{p-a} \left(\frac{\answer{a-p}}{pa} \right)  \\
                                                  &=  \lim_{\answer{p\to a}} \frac{\answer{-10}}{pa} \\
                                                  & = \answer{\frac{-10}{a^2}} .
\end{align*}
\end{hint}

\item Evaluate the derivative 
\[
         \frac{dn}{dp} \Big|_{p=2} . 
\]

\item What are the units of the above derivative?

\item Interpret the meaning of the above derivative. Click the arrow to the lower right for help.

\begin{expandable}

For a way to interpret the meaning of the derivative 
\[
         \frac{dn}{dp} \Big|_{p=2} . 
\]
we can ask ourselves what happens to the number of pounds of apples we can buy with $\$10$ if the price changes by a small amount from $\$2$/lb. For this, let $\Delta p$ be a small change in price from $\$2$/lb (measured in dollars/lb) and let $\Delta n$ be the corresponding change in the number of pounds we can buy with $\$10$.

For $\Delta p \sim 0$, we have
\[
    \answer{-2.5} =  \frac{dn}{dp} \Big|_{p=2} \sim \frac{\Delta n}{\Delta p} 
\]
and (type ``Delta'' for $\Delta$)
\[
     \Delta n \sim   \answer{-2.5 \Delta p}.
\]
This tells us that if the price increases from $\$2$/lb to say $\$2.10$/lb, then 
\[
   \Delta n \sim \left( \answer{-2.5} \frac{\text{lb}}{\$/\text{lb}} \right) \left( \answer{0.10} \frac{\$}{\text{lb}}  \right) =                        \answer{-0.25}\text{ lbs}.
\]
So if the price increases from $\$2$/lb to say $\$2.10$/lb, we can buy about $\answer{0.25}$ fewer pounds of apples with ten dollars. 

\end{expandable}

\item Next we'll use the worksheet below to visualize the approximate change
\begin{align*}
  \Delta n     & \sim  \left( \frac{dn}{dp}\Big|_{p=2} \right)\Delta p \\
                   &=  \left( -2.5\frac{\text{lb}}{\$/\text{lb}} \right) \left( 0.10 \frac{\$}{\text{lb}}  \right)  \\
                   &=   -0.25\text{ lbs}.
\end{align*}
in the number of pounds of apples we can buy with $\$10$ as the price increases from $\$2$/lb to $\$2.10$/lb.

\begin{enumerate}
\item To get started, find an equation (in point-slope form) of the tangent line to the curve $n=f(p)$ at the point $P$ with coordinates $(2,5)$. The tangent line has a slope equal to the derivative 
\[
   \frac{dn}{dp} \Big|_{p=2} .
\]
So its equation is 
\[
      n = 5 + \answer{-2.5(p-2)} .
\]

\item Enter your equation of the tangent line on Line 17 of the desmos worksheet.

\item Activate the folders \emph{tangent line} and \emph{linear approximation} on Lines 18 and 22. 

\item Explain why the difference in the $n$-coordinates of points $P$ and $R^\prime$ (ie. $n$-coordinate of $R^\prime$ minus $n$-coordinate of $P$) is equal to our approximation of $\Delta n$ above when $Q$ as coordinates $(2.10,f(2.10))$.

\item Drag Slider $v$ on Line 2 to make $Q$ approach $P$. What so  you think happens to the ratio of $\Delta n$ to our approximation of $\Delta n$ as $v\to 2$?
\end{enumerate}


\item We can get a better understanding of the changes 
\[
      \Delta p = 2.1 - 2 = 0.10 \text{ dollars/pound}
\]
and 
\[
   \Delta n = f(2.1)-f(2) \sim 0.25 \text { pounds}
\]
by thinking about relative instead of absolute change.

An increase in price from $\$2$/lb to $\$2.10$/lb is a relative change of
\[
    \frac{\Delta p}{p} = \frac{\$0.1/\text{lb}}{\$ 2/\text{lb}} = 0.05 = 5\% .
\]
This causes a relative change in the number of pounds we can buy of approximately
\[
    \frac{\Delta n}{n} \sim \frac{\answer{-0.25} \text{lbs}}{\answer{5}\text{lbs}} = \answer{-0.05} = \answer{-5}\%.
\]
 
\item We can get a the same result relating the two relative changes of the previous question by working in general. 

Suppose we increase the price of apples by $Q\%$, where $Q\sim 0$. What can we say about the relative change in the number of pounds of apples we can buy with $\$10$?

Well, if the change in price $\Delta p$ is near zero and $\Delta n$ is the corresponding change in the number of pounds we can buy, then 
\[
    \frac{\Delta n}{\Delta p}   \sim  \frac{dn}{dp} = \answer{-10/p^2}.
\]
So
\[
     \Delta n \sim \left( \answer{\frac{-10}{p^2}} \right) \Delta p.
\]
Dividing both sides by $n = 10/p$ tells us that
\[
        \frac{\Delta n}{n} \sim \left( \answer{\frac{-10}{p^2}} \right)\left( \frac{\Delta p}{\frac{10}{p}} \right) = -\frac{\Delta p}{\answer{p}} = -Q\%.
\]

So if we increase the price by $Q\%\sim 0$, then the number of apples we can buy decreases by approximately that same $Q\%$.

\item We can think about this relationship between the relative changes geometrically. To do this, remove your equation of the tangent line on Line 17 and activate the folder \emph{tangent line} in the worksheet above. Then drag slider $a$ on Line 4 to move point $P$. What do you notice about the ratio  $PB:PA$ of the distances $PA$ and $PB$ as $P$ moves? More on this later.

\begin{question} \label{QGETGG3fg44}
Due to a printing error, the graph of the function
\[
      n = f(p)  \, , \, p>0 ,
\]
expressing the number of pounds of an item we can buy with $\$100$ in terms of the price (measured in $\$/\text{lb}$) is not shown below. All we can see is a point $A$ on the graph.

The problem is to draw the tangent line to the graph at $A$ \emph{without} sketching the graph or doing any kind of computation. Click the arrow below for a hint.

\begin{expandable}
The key idea is to relate the slope of the tangent line at $A$ to the slope of the line $OA$ through the origin and $A$.


We know that
\[
      n = f(p)  = \frac{100}{p} \, , \, p>0 ,
\]
and
\[
 \frac{dn}{dp} =\answer{-100/p^2} .
\]

Now write this derivative in terms of both $n$ and $p$, 
\[
   \frac{dn}{dp} =\answer{-\frac{100}{p^2}} = \answer{-\frac{n}{p}} .
\]

Now relate this to the slope of line $OA$ and draw the tangent line at $A$.

\section{Intensity of Sound}

\begin{question}  \label{Qdfdgt446666}
The \emph{intensity} of sound is measured in Watts per square meter and is a function of the distance from the source. For a typical vacuum cleaner, this function is
\[
          I = f(r) = \frac{k}{r^2} \, , \, r\geq 1 ,
\]
where $r$ is the distance (in meters) from the vacuum cleaner and $k=10^{-4}\text{watts}\cdot m^2$ is a constant.
